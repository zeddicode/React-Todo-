# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application also persists tasks in the browser's localStorage.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a name and description.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks with a confirmation prompt.
- Mark tasks as completed or active.
- Persist tasks between sessions using localStorage.

## Additional Considerations

- The application includes basic form validation to ensure that both the task name and description are filled out before adding or editing a task.
- Styling is applied to distinguish between active and completed tasks.
